# Planet_Orbitals
The constants for all the planets I got from 
      - https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/.

Websites in which I got my infromation and images from.
The textures I obtained from a combination of these sites and I scaled and rotated them to fit my needs
      - http://planetpixelemporium.com/planets.html
      - https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/
      
For Mayavi plotting the guide was on 
      - http://scipy-lectures.org/advanced/3d_plotting/index.html

For future use make sure the file path contains all the planetary images.
